/*To find the in-order successor of a given node in a binary tree where each node has a pointer to its parent, we can leverage the properties of in-order traversal. In-order traversal visits nodes in the following order:

Left subtree
Current node
Right subtree
Key Observations:
If the node has a right child, then the successor is the leftmost node in the node's right subtree.
If the node doesn't have a right child, the successor is one of the node's ancestors. Specifically, it's the first ancestor whose left child is also an ancestor of the node.
Steps:
Right Child Exists: If the node has a right child, go to the right child and then keep traversing left until you reach the leftmost node. This node is the successor.
No Right Child: If the node does not have a right child, move up to the parent. Continue moving up until you move from a left child to its parent. That parent will be the successor.
No Successor: If neither of the above conditions is met, the node has no in-order successor (itâ€™s the last node in the in-order traversal).
Time Complexity:
O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, you may have to traverse up the tree from the node to the root, which takes O(h) time.
Space Complexity:
O(1): No extra space is required beyond the input.*/

/*
Explanation:
findSuccessor Function:
Case 1: If the node has a right subtree, we find its in-order successor by getting the leftmost node of that subtree.
Case 2: If there is no right subtree, we trace the parent pointers until we find a node that is the left child of its parent, which will be our successor.
getLeftmostChild Function: This function finds the leftmost child of a node, which is useful for finding the successor in a right subtree.
getRightAncestor Function: This function traverses up the tree to find the first ancestor that is the parent of a left child, which will be the successor.
This approach efficiently finds the in-order successor by considering both cases (with and without a right child) and handles edge cases gracefully.*/
