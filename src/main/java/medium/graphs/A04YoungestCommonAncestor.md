Below is a walkthrough of both pieces of code you’ve provided—first for finding the youngest common ancestor in a general “ancestral‐tree” (where each node has a single parent pointer), and then for finding the lowest common ancestor in a binary tree.

---

## 1. Youngest Common Ancestor in an Ancestral Tree

### Problem Restatement

You have a tree in which each node has exactly one `ancestor` pointer (except the top ancestor, whose `ancestor = null`). Given:

* `topAncestor` – the root of that tree,
* `descendantOne` and `descendantTwo` – two nodes somewhere below the root,

return the “youngest” (i.e. deepest) node in the tree that is an ancestor of both descendants.

Because each node only stores a pointer to its parent (no pointers to children), the standard approach is:

1. Compute the depth of each descendant (distance from `topAncestor`).
2. “Lift” the deeper descendant up until both descendants reside at the same depth.
3. Move both pointers upward in tandem until they meet. The meeting point is the youngest common ancestor.

### Code Explanation

```java
static class AncestralTree {
  public AncestralTree ancestor;
  // (You may add a “name” or “value” field if you want to distinguish nodes, but it isn’t required here.)
}

/**
 * Returns the youngest common ancestor of descendantOne and descendantTwo,
 * given that topAncestor is the root of the entire ancestral tree.
 */
public static AncestralTree getYoungestCommonAncestor(
    AncestralTree topAncestor,
    AncestralTree descendantOne,
    AncestralTree descendantTwo
) {
  // 1) Find depths of both descendants relative to the topAncestor
  int depthOne = getDepth(descendantOne, topAncestor);
  int depthTwo = getDepth(descendantTwo, topAncestor);

  // 2) “Elevate” whichever descendant is deeper up until they share the same depth
  if (depthOne > depthTwo) {
    descendantOne = moveUpToEqualDepth(descendantOne, depthOne - depthTwo);
  } else if (depthTwo > depthOne) {
    descendantTwo = moveUpToEqualDepth(descendantTwo, depthTwo - depthOne);
  }

  // 3) Now both nodes are at the same depth. Move them upward in lockstep
  //    until they point to the same node.
  while (descendantOne != descendantTwo) {
    descendantOne = descendantOne.ancestor;
    descendantTwo = descendantTwo.ancestor;
  }
  return descendantOne; // (or descendantTwo—they are equal here)
}

/** 
 * Returns how many steps it is from `node` up to the `topAncestor`.
 * In other words, depth = number of “ancestor” hops from node to topAncestor.
 */
private static int getDepth(AncestralTree node, AncestralTree topAncestor) {
  int depth = 0;
  while (node != topAncestor) {
    node = node.ancestor;
    depth++;
  }
  return depth;
}

/**
 * Takes a node and moves it “up” `dist` steps along its ancestor pointers.
 * If dist > 0, it simply follows ancestor pointers dist times.
 */
private static AncestralTree moveUpToEqualDepth(AncestralTree node, int dist) {
  while (dist > 0) {
    node = node.ancestor;
    dist--;
  }
  return node;
}
```

### Why This Works

1. **Depth Calculation** (`getDepth`):
   We walk from the node up to `topAncestor`, counting how many “ancestor” hops it takes. That is its depth.

2. **Equalizing Depths**:
   If `descendantOne` is deeper, we move it up `(depthOne – depthTwo)` steps. After that, both `descendantOne` and `descendantTwo` are the same number of hops away from `topAncestor`.

3. **Stepping Up Together**:
   Once both nodes sit at the same depth, their lowest common ancestor must lie somewhere above them. We move each pointer up one step at a time:

   * If they meet immediately, that is the LCA.
   * If not, we keep moving both pointers up in parallel until they converge. Because they were level‐aligned, the first time they match must be their lowest (youngest) common ancestor.

* **Time Complexity:**

  * `getDepth` runs in O(d) where d is the depth of the node.
  * You call it twice (once per descendant), then “lift” one node at most O(d) steps to equalize, then possibly walk up another O(d) steps until the pointers meet.
    → Overall O(d), which is O(tree height) in the worst case.

* **Space Complexity:** O(1), because we only keep a few integer counters and pointers—no extra data structures.

## 2. Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree

This is a classic binary‐tree problem (each node has pointers `left` and `right` instead of a parent pointer). The goal: given a binary tree’s `root`, and two nodes `p` and `q` somewhere in that tree, return their lowest (i.e. deepest) common ancestor. In a binary tree, an LCA node is the first node on the path from each descendant up to the root where their paths intersect.

### Recursive DFS Method

```java
// Definition for a binary tree node (standard LeetCode‐style).
class TreeNode {
  int val;
  TreeNode left;
  TreeNode right;
  TreeNode(int x) {
    val = x;
    left = null;
    right = null;
  }
}

class Solution {
  /**
   * Finds the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of p and q in a binary tree rooted at root.
   * If root is null or root is p or root is q, return root immediately.
   * Otherwise, search left and right subtrees for p and q.
   */
  public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
    // Base cases:
    // 1) If root is null, there is no LCA here.
    // 2) If root == p or root == q, then root is part of the answer (itself).
    if (root == null || root.val == p.val || root.val == q.val) {
      return root;
    }

    // Recurse left and right
    TreeNode leftLca  = lowestCommonAncestor(root.left,  p, q);
    TreeNode rightLca = lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);

    // If leftLca != null AND rightLca != null, p and q are found in different subtrees.
    // Hence root is their LCA.
    if (leftLca != null && rightLca != null) {
      return root;
    }

    // Otherwise, if one side returned non‐null, that means either:
    //  a) That side contains both p and q in its subtree, so it found the LCA deeper down.
    //  b) That side contains exactly one of p or q, and the other side had none—so that node is the LCA.
    return (leftLca != null) ? leftLca : rightLca;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Build a sample tree:
    //         3
    //       /   \
    //      5     1
    //     / \   / \
    //    6  2  0   8
    //      / \
    //     7   4
    TreeNode root = new TreeNode(3);
    root.left  = new TreeNode(5);
    root.right = new TreeNode(1);
    root.left.left   = new TreeNode(6);
    root.left.right  = new TreeNode(2);
    root.right.left  = new TreeNode(0);
    root.right.right = new TreeNode(8);
    root.left.right.left  = new TreeNode(7);
    root.left.right.right = new TreeNode(4);

    Solution solution = new Solution();
    // Find LCA of nodes 5 and 1 → expected answer is 3 (the root).
    TreeNode lca = solution.lowestCommonAncestor(root, root.left, root.right);
    System.out.println("LCA of 5 and 1 is: " + lca.val); // prints 3
  }
}
```

### Why This Works

1. **Base Case Checks:**

   * If `root == null`, there’s no ancestor here—return `null`.
   * If `root == p` or `root == q`, we have found one of the target nodes. We return it so that the caller knows “this subtree contains p (or q).”

2. **Recursive Calls**

   * We call `lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)` → let’s call that `leftLca`.
   * We call `lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)` → call that `rightLca`.

3. **Combining Results:**

   * If **both** `leftLca` and `rightLca` are non‐null, it means:

     * One of `p` or `q` (or their LCA) was found in the left subtree,
     * The other was found in the right subtree.
     * Therefore, the current `root` is the **earliest (lowest) node** where p’s path and q’s path “meet.”
       So we return `root`.
   * If **only one** of them is non‐null (and the other is null), it means both `p` and `q` are down that same subtree, or only one of them is found at all, so we propagate that non‐null node upward. That non‐null result is either:

     * The actual LCA found deeper down, or
     * Exactly `p` (if `q` doesn’t exist in the tree) or `q`.

4. **Finished**
   Once the recursion unwinds all the way up to the original call, you get the final lowest common ancestor.

* **Time Complexity:** O(n) — in the worst case, you visit every node once.
* **Space Complexity:** O(h) — where h is the height of the tree, due to recursion stack.

### Summary

* **Youngest Common Ancestor (with parent‐pointers only):**

  1. Compute each node’s depth (distance from the root).
  2. Lift the deeper node until both nodes are at the same depth.
  3. Move both pointers up together until they converge.
  4. O(height) time, O(1) extra space.

* **Lowest Common Ancestor in a Binary Tree (no parent pointers, only left/right):**

  1. Recursively search left and right subtrees.
  2. If both sides return non‐null, current node is LCA.
  3. Otherwise propagate whatever non‐null result you got upward.
  4. O(n) time, O(h) stack space.

Either solution correctly returns the common ancestor you want, but they apply to different data‐structure setups (one uses a single “parent” pointer per node; the other uses “left”/“right” child pointers).
