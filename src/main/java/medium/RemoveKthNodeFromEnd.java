/*
 * Problem Statement:
 * Write a function that takes in the head of a Singly Linked List and an integer k,
 * and removes the kth node from the end of the list.
 *
 * The removal should be done in place, meaning that the original data structure
 * should be mutated (no new structure should be created).
 *
 * The input head of the linked list should remain the head of the linked list after
 * the removal is done, even if the head is the node that's supposed to be removed.
 *
 * The function doesn't need to return anything.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - The input linked list will always have at least two nodes and, specifically, at least k nodes.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9, k = 4
 * After Removal: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9
 * // The 4th node from the end of the list (the node with value 6) is removed.

/*Brute Force Solution
Approach:
The brute force approach involves two passes through the linked list. In the first pass, determine the length of the list. In the second pass, find and remove the kth node from the end.

Time Complexity:
O(n): We iterate through the list twiceâ€”once to calculate the length and once to remove the kth node.
Space Complexity:
O(1): We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.*/

Optimized Solution: Two-Pointer Technique
Approach:
The optimized solution uses a two-pointer technique. The first pointer advances k nodes ahead, and then both pointers move together until the first pointer reaches the end. The second pointer will then be at the node just before the one to remove.

Time Complexity:
O(n): We only traverse the list once, making this a linear time solution.
Space Complexity:
O(1): The extra space used is constant.*/
