**Problem Restatement**
Given two strings `stringOne` and `stringTwo`, you want to determine whether you can make them identical by performing at most **one** of these edits:

1. **Replace** exactly one character in one string with a different character.
2. **Insert** exactly one character anywhere in one string.
3. **Remove** exactly one character anywhere in one string.

If the strings are already equal, that counts as zero edits—so you should return `true`. Otherwise, return `true` only if exactly one such operation suffices; otherwise return `false`.

---

## Overview of the Approach (O(n) Time, O(1) Space)

1. **If the strings are already identical**, return `true`.
2. **If their lengths differ by more than 1**, you cannot fix them with a single edit (because inserting or removing one character can only change length by 1). Return `false`.
3. **If their lengths are equal**, the only possible single‐edit fix is **one replace**. Check that they differ in exactly one position.
4. **If one is exactly one character longer**, the only possible fix is **one insert/remove**. Check that, by walking through both strings in tandem, you can “skip” exactly one character in the longer string to make them match everywhere else.
5. Otherwise, return `false`.

Because you only traverse each string at most once (or twice, in the worst case), the time complexity is $O(n)$, where $n$ is the length of the shorter string. You only use a few integer pointers and booleans—no extra arrays—so space is $O(1)$.

## Detailed Solution

```java
package medium.strings;

public class A06OneEditAway {

  /**
   * Returns true if stringOne can be turned into stringTwo with at most one edit
   * (insert, remove, or replace exactly one character). If they're already equal, return true.
   *
   * Time: O(n)  (n = length of shorter string)
   * Space: O(1)
   */
  public static boolean isOneEditAway(String stringOne, String stringTwo) {
    // 1) If they’re already equal, no edits are needed.
    if (stringOne.equals(stringTwo)) {
      return true;
    }

    int len1 = stringOne.length();
    int len2 = stringTwo.length();

    // 2) If lengths differ by more than 1, can’t fix it with a single insert/remove.
    if (Math.abs(len1 - len2) > 1) {
      return false;
    }

    // 3) If lengths are the same, check for exactly one possible replace.
    if (len1 == len2) {
      return isOneReplaceAway(stringOne, stringTwo);
    }

    // 4) If one is longer by exactly 1, check for one possible insert/remove.
    if (len1 + 1 == len2) {
      // stringTwo is longer by one
      return isOneAddRemoveAway(stringOne, stringTwo);
    } else if (len1 - 1 == len2) {
      // stringOne is longer by one
      return isOneAddRemoveAway(stringTwo, stringOne);
    }

    // 5) Otherwise, more than one edit is needed
    return false;

    boolean foundDifference = false;

    for (int i = 0; i < str1.length(); i++) {

          // Already found one mismatch before; this is a second mismatch
          return false;
        }

    // If we reach here, we never found more than one extra mismatch. Either we used an insertion skip or the extra char is at the very end.

    String stringOne3 = "helo";
    String stringTwo3 = "hello";
    System.out.println(isOneEditAway(stringOne3, stringTwo3));

### Why This Works

1. **Early Equality Check**

   ```java
   if (stringOne.equals(stringTwo)) return true;
   ```

   If the strings are already identical, no edits are needed, so return `true` immediately.

2. **Length Difference Check**

   ```java
   if (Math.abs(len1 - len2) > 1) return false;
   ```

   An insertion or deletion changes length by exactly 1, and a replacement keeps length the same. If the length difference exceeds 1, you cannot fix it with a single edit, so return `false`.

3. **Single Replace Case (lengths equal)**

   * Walk through both strings in tandem.
   * Keep a boolean `foundDifference` initially false.
   * Whenever characters differ at index `i`, if `foundDifference` was already true, that means this is the second mismatch—so more than one replace would be needed. Return `false`. Otherwise, set `foundDifference = true` and continue.
   * If you finish the loop with zero or one mismatch, return `true`.

4. **Single Insert/Remove Case (length difference = 1)**

   * Suppose `longer` is the one character longer. We want to see if you can remove exactly one character from `longer` to match `shorter`.
   * Maintain two pointers, `i` for `shorter` and `j` for `longer`. Compare `shorter[i]` vs. `longer[j]`.

     * If they match, advance both `i++` and `j++`.
     * If they don’t match:

       * If `i != j` already, that means you’ve previously “skipped” a character in `longer`. You cannot skip again—return `false`.
       * Otherwise, skip one character in `longer` by doing `j++` (this simulates “removing” that character). Keep `i` the same to re‐compare.
   * If you exit the loop without more than one skip, return `true`. Even if the mismatch is at the very end (e.g. `shorter = "abc"`, `longer = "abcd"`), the while loop finishes with `i=3, j=3`, and you only skipped once at the end—still valid.

This covers all three edit possibilities (replace when lengths match, insert or remove when lengths differ by 1), plus the zero‐edit case.
