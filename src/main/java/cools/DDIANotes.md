### üìò **Chapter 1: Summary ‚Äì Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications**

#### ‚úÖ Key Requirements for Applications:

* **Functional requirements**: What the app **should do** (e.g., storing, retrieving, searching data).
* **Non-functional requirements**: General qualities like:

  * **Reliability**
  * **Scalability**
  * **Maintainability**
  * (Also includes security, compliance, compatibility, etc.)

---

### üõ°Ô∏è **Reliability**

* Ensures the system works **correctly**, even during faults.
* Faults may arise from:

  * Hardware (random, rare)
  * Software (systematic bugs)
  * Human errors (inevitable)
* **Fault tolerance** techniques can mask some errors from users.

---

### üìà **Scalability**

* The ability to **maintain performance** as load increases.
* Requires measuring load and performance (e.g., Twitter‚Äôs timeline, percentiles for response times).
* Scalable systems allow **increasing processing capacity** to handle higher load without failure.

---

### üîß **Maintainability**

* Makes systems easier to **operate, update, and manage**.
* Benefits for engineering and operations teams:

  * **Abstractions** reduce complexity.
  * Systems are easier to modify and extend.
  * Good **observability** = visibility into health and issues.
  * Effective **management tools** are important.

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Final Thought

* There is **no universal fix** for making apps reliable, scalable, and maintainable.
* But common **patterns and techniques** can help.

Absolutely! Here are **clear and concise notes** on **SQL vs NoSQL**, including **when to use each** ‚Äî perfect for interviews or quick revision:

---

### üÜö **SQL vs NoSQL ‚Äì Quick Comparison**

| Feature            | SQL (Relational DB)                     | NoSQL (Non-Relational DB)                         |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Model**     | Tables with rows and columns            | Key-Value, Document, Column, or Graph             |
| **Schema**         | Fixed, predefined schema                | Dynamic, flexible schema                          |
| **Query Language** | SQL (Structured Query Language)         | Varies (MongoDB, CQL, etc.)                       |
| **Transactions**   | Strong ACID compliance                  | Often BASE (eventual consistency)                 |
| **Scalability**    | Vertical (scale-up: bigger server)      | Horizontal (scale-out: more servers)              |
| **Use Case Type**  | Structured, relational, consistent data | Large-scale, unstructured or semi-structured data |

---

### ‚úÖ **When to Use SQL**

1. **Data consistency is a must**
   üî∏ Use cases: Banking, e-commerce orders, payment processing
   üî∏ Why: Guarantees accurate transactions (ACID)

2. **Complex joins and relationships**
   üî∏ Use cases: HR systems, ERPs, school management
   üî∏ Why: SQL excels at relational data

3. **Structured, well-defined schema**
   üî∏ Use cases: Inventory management, CRM
   üî∏ Why: Tables enforce structure and constraints

4. **Integrity and validations**
   üî∏ Use cases: Healthcare, insurance
   üî∏ Why: SQL enforces foreign keys, constraints, normalization

---

### ‚úÖ **When to Use NoSQL**

1. **High write/read scalability is needed**
   üî∏ Use cases: Social media feeds, IoT, logs
   üî∏ Why: NoSQL handles large-scale, distributed systems

2. **Schema flexibility or frequent changes**
   üî∏ Use cases: Product catalogs, user-generated content
   üî∏ Why: Schema-less models adapt easily

3. **Low-latency or real-time performance**
   üî∏ Use cases: Leaderboards, real-time chat, shopping carts
   üî∏ Why: Key-Value stores like Redis offer fast access

4. **Eventual consistency is okay**
   üî∏ Use cases: Analytics, page views, likes
   üî∏ Why: Prioritizes availability and partition tolerance (CAP)

---

### üí° **Best Practice: Hybrid Use (Polyglot Persistence)**

Use SQL for transactional systems + NoSQL for logging, analytics, caching, etc.
üëâ Example: E-commerce site with:

* **MySQL** for orders/payments
* **MongoDB** for product listings
* **Redis** for caching session data

---

Here are **well-organized notes** for the passage you provided from *Designing Data-Intensive Applications* ‚Äì summarizing key points from the **chapter on Data Models**:

---

### üìò **Chapter Summary: Data Models**

---

### üß© **Overview of Data Models**

* Data modeling is a **broad and foundational topic**.
* The chapter provided a **high-level view** of major data models:

  * Relational
  * Document
  * Graph

---

### üß± **Historical Evolution**

1. **Hierarchical Model**

   * Data represented as a **tree**
   * Poor at handling **many-to-many relationships**

2. **Relational Model**

   * Introduced to **solve limitations** of hierarchical structure
   * Works well for **structured data** and **relationships**

3. **NoSQL Models**

   * Emerged to address cases relational DBs **don't fit well**
   * Two primary directions:

     * **Document Databases**: For self-contained documents, minimal relationships (e.g., MongoDB)
     * **Graph Databases**: For highly interconnected data (e.g., Neo4j)

---

### üîÅ **Use-Case Fit**

* All three models are widely used, each excelling in **different scenarios**.
* Models can **emulate each other** (e.g., representing graph in SQL), but often feel **awkward or inefficient**.
* No one-size-fits-all ‚Äî different tools serve **different purposes**.

---

### üìê **Schema Flexibility**

* **Document & Graph DBs** often don‚Äôt enforce schema:

  * **Schema-on-read**: Structure is inferred when reading
  * Contrast with SQL‚Äôs **schema-on-write**

---

### üîç **Query Languages by Model**

* Each model has a different query interface:

  * **Relational** ‚Üí SQL
  * **Document** ‚Üí MongoDB Query, Aggregation Pipeline
  * **Graph** ‚Üí Cypher, SPARQL, Datalog
  * Others: MapReduce (batch jobs), XPath/CSS (for XML/HTML-like trees)

---

### üåê **Specialized Use Cases (Beyond Mainstream Models)**

* Not all use cases are supported by standard databases:

  * **Genomics**: Sequence matching (e.g., GenBank)
  * **Particle Physics**: Petabyte-scale analytics (e.g., LHC)
  * **Full-text Search**: Specialized indexing (e.g., ElasticSearch)

---

### üß† **Key Takeaway**

> Different applications need **different data models** ‚Äî choose the right one based on **data structure**, **relationships**, **scale**, and **query needs**.

---

### üîπ What is a **Materialized View** in SQL?

A **Materialized View** is a **precomputed** result of a SQL query that is **stored** on disk like a regular table. Unlike a **normal view**, which computes data **on the fly** when queried, a materialized view **saves the data** physically and can be **refreshed** periodically.

---

### ‚úÖ Key Features:

| Feature         | Description                                       |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stored Data** | Yes ‚Äî behaves like a snapshot of a query          |
| **Query Speed** | Much faster than regular views for large data     |
| **Refreshable** | Can be refreshed manually or automatically        |
| **Use Cases**   | Aggregations, joins, expensive queries, reporting |

---

### üîç **Example:**

```sql
-- Creating a materialized view to precompute total sales by product
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW total_sales_mv
AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;
```

* This creates a snapshot of the total sales grouped by product.
* Instead of recalculating each time, SQL can just read the stored results.

---

### üîÑ **Refreshing a Materialized View**

* **Manual Refresh:**

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW total_sales_mv;
```

* **Automatic Refresh:**

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW total_sales_mv
BUILD IMMEDIATE
REFRESH FAST
ON COMMIT
AS
SELECT product_id, SUM(sales_amount)
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_id;
```

---

### üîÅ **Materialized View vs View**

| Feature            | **View**                  | **Materialized View**        |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Data Storage       | No (virtual)              | Yes (physical)               |
| Performance        | Slower (query every time) | Faster (precomputed)         |
| Use Case           | Real-time data            | Aggregated/periodic data     |
| Refresh Capability | Not applicable            | Supports manual/auto refresh |

---

### üìå When to Use:

* To **speed up** slow queries involving **joins**, **aggregations**, or **large data sets**
* In **reporting dashboards** where **real-time data** isn't critical
* For **read-heavy** workloads where data doesn't change too often

---

Here are concise and structured üìò **notes** for the **chapter summary** you provided from *Designing Data-Intensive Applications*, focusing on how databases handle **storage and retrieval**:

---

### üì¶ **Database Storage & Retrieval ‚Äì Summary Notes**

---

### üîÅ **Two Major Categories of Storage Engines**

1. **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)**

   * **User-facing systems**
   * High volume of **small, key-based queries**
   * **Disk seek time** is the major bottleneck
   * Relies heavily on **indexes**

2. **OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) / Data Warehousing**

   * **Used by analysts**, not end users
   * Low volume, **highly complex queries**
   * **Scans millions of rows at once**
   * Bottleneck: **Disk bandwidth**, not seek time
   * **Column-oriented storage** improves performance

---

### üß± **Storage Engine Design Philosophies (OLTP)**

#### 1. **Log-Structured Storage Engines**

* **Append-only writes**, delete old files
* Avoid in-place updates
* Converts **random writes ‚Üí sequential writes**
* Optimized for **high write throughput**

‚úÖ Examples:

* **Bitcask**, **SSTables**, **LSM Trees**
* Used in **LevelDB**, **Cassandra**, **HBase**, **Lucene**

#### 2. **Update-In-Place Storage Engines**

* **Overwrites** existing disk pages
* Disk treated as **fixed-size blocks**
* Ideal for **read-heavy** workloads

‚úÖ Example:

* **B-trees** (Used in most relational DBs like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.)

---

### üîé **Indexing & In-Memory Optimizations**

* Explored **advanced indexing** structures
* Some databases **keep all data in RAM** for ultra-fast access (e.g., Redis)

---

### üß† **OLAP/Data Warehouse Design Insights**

* **Sequential scans** of data = index not very helpful
* Use **compact encoding** and **columnar storage**
* Purpose: **Minimize disk I/O** by reading only necessary data

---

### üéØ **Developer Takeaways**

* Understanding storage internals helps you:

  * Choose the **right database engine** for your workload
  * Tune performance by adjusting database parameters intelligently
* You now have the **vocabulary and concepts** to explore database docs and optimize storage settings for your app
