Below are structured revision notes covering **all major concepts** and design steps described in Chapter 1 (“Scale from Zero to Millions of Users”). Use these bullets as a quick-reference guide when revisiting the material.

---

## 1. Single-Server Setup (Monolith)

* **Everything on one box:**

  * Web/server (HTML + JSON APIs)
  * Application code (business logic, e.g., Java/Python)
  * Relational database (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
  * In-memory cache (local Redis/Memcached)
  * File storage for uploads (local disk)
* **Request Flow:**

  1. DNS → returns server IP
  2. Browser/mobile sends HTTP to that IP
  3. Web server handles request, queries local DB/cache
  4. Response (HTML/JSON) returned
* **Pros:** simple to build/deploy, minimal cost, everything collocated
* **Cons:**

  * SPOF (if server dies, entire app is down)
  * Vertical limits (single CPU/RAM/disk)
  * Mixed concerns (hard to scale individual tiers)

---

## 2. Split Web & Database (Separate Tiers)

* **Move DB to its own server:**

  * **Web Tier:** one machine runs web/API + app code
  * **Data Tier:** separate machine for DB
* **Benefits:**

  * Independent scaling of web vs. database
  * Improved fault isolation (web crash ≠ DB crash)
* **Limitations:**

  * Still SPOF at each individual server
  * Database can become bottleneck if not replicated

---

## 3. Vertical vs. Horizontal Scaling

* **Vertical Scaling (“Scale Up”):**

  * Add CPU, RAM, disk to a single server
  * **Pros:** easy to implement (e.g., upgrade EC2 instance type)
  * **Cons:** hard hardware limits, no built-in failover, expensive at high end
* **Horizontal Scaling (“Scale Out”):**

  * Add more servers (e.g., more web nodes, more DB read replicas, more caches)
  * **Pros:** virtually unlimited, built-in redundancy, easier failover
  * **Cons:** requires coordination (load balancer, sharding, replication)

---

## 4. Load Balancer (Web-Tier Availability)

* **Role:** distribute incoming HTTP traffic evenly across multiple web servers
* **Types:**

  * Layer 7 (Application Load Balancer for HTTP/HTTPS)
  * Layer 4 (Network Load Balancer for TCP/SSL pass-through)
* **Key Features:**

  * **Health Checks:** LB pings `/health` on each web node; only routes to healthy
  * **SSL Termination:** optional offload of TLS at the LB
  * **Sticky Sessions:** not required if sessions are centralized (avoid for true statelessness)
* **Benefits:**

  * Eliminates single-server bottleneck for web tier
  * Supports rolling updates (take servers in/out of rotation)
  * Improves fault tolerance

---

## 5. Database Replication (Master-Slave)

* **Master (Primary) DB:** accepts all write operations (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
* **Slave (Replica) DBs:** replicate data asynchronously; serve read-only queries
* **Read/Write Routing:**

  * **Writes → Master**
  * **Reads → Slaves** (reduces load on master)
* **High-Level Behavior on Failures:**

  * Slave goes offline → reads temporarily fallback to Master (or other slaves)
  * Master goes offline → promote one slave to become new Master (requires data catch-up)
* **Replication Pros:**

  * Read scaling (parallelize read queries)
  * Better reliability (data exists in multiple machines)
  * High availability (if one DB node fails, others can serve)

---

## 6. Caching Layer (Cache Tier)

* **Why Cache:** reading frequently accessed data from memory is much faster than hitting the DB each time
* **Cache Tier Components:**

  * Dedicated Redis or Memcached servers (clustered, multi-AZ)
* **Common Strategy: “Cache Aside” (Read-Through):**

  1. Web server checks cache (by cache key)
  2. If **cache hit**: return cached data immediately
  3. If **cache miss**: query database → store result in cache (with TTL) → return data
* **Other Strategies (depending on use case):**

  * Write-Through (synchronously write cache + DB)
  * Write-Back (write to cache first, flush to DB later)
* **Cache Considerations:**

  * **Expiration Policy (TTL):**

    * Too short → frequent DB reads
    * Too long → data staleness
  * **Eviction Policy:**

    * LRU (Least Recently Used) default
    * LFU or FIFO if data access patterns require
  * **SPOF Mitigation:**

    * Run multiple cache nodes across zones or regions
    * Over-provision memory to handle spikes
  * **Consistency:**

    * Writes to DB and cache can be out of sync
    * In multi-region setups, keeping caches in sync is challenging

---

## 7. Content Delivery Network (CDN)

* **Purpose:** serve static assets (images, CSS, JS, video) from edge locations closest to users → drastically lower latency + offload origin servers
* **Workflow:**

  1. User requests `cdn.example.com/logo.jpg` → DNS directs to nearest CDN PoP (edge server)
  2. If **cache miss** at the edge → fetch asset from origin (web server or object store), cache it at edge, deliver to user
  3. Subsequent requests served from CDN cache (until TTL expires)
* **Static Asset Storage:**

  * Origin can be a web server or object storage service (e.g., Amazon S3)
* **Key Configurations:**

  * **Cache-Control Headers:**

    * Long TTL (e.g., `max-age=31536000, immutable`) for fingerprinted assets
    * Short TTL for frequently updated files
  * **Invalidation:**

    * Purge via CDN API or use file versioning (append a query string or hashed filename)
* **Considerations:**

  * **Cost:** charged per GB transferred; avoid caching rarely accessed assets
  * **Fallback:** if CDN fails, client should be able to fetch from origin directly
  * **Geographic Coverage:** ensure PoPs in regions where your users are

---

## 8. Stateless vs. Stateful Web Tier

* **Stateful Server:**

  * Stores session/user state locally (in memory or on local disk)
  * **Issue:** all requests for a given user must hit the same server (“sticky sessions”), making scaling and failover difficult
* **Stateless Server:**

  * Does **not** store session state locally
  * Session data stored in a shared store (e.g., Redis, relational/NoSQL DB, or JWT tokens)
  * Any web server can handle any user’s request
* **Benefits of Statelessness:**

  * True horizontal scaling (auto-scaling groups can add/remove servers at will)
  * Simplified load balancing (no sticky sessions required)
  * Easier rolling deployments (pull traffic away from old instances, deploy new ones)

---

## 9. Multi–Data Center / Multi-Region

* **Why Multi-Region:**

  * Lower latency (serve users from nearest data center)
  * Higher availability (in case one region/data center fails)
* **GeoDNS (Geo-Routed DNS):**

  * DNS returns IP of closest data center based on user’s location
  * Traffic split (e.g., x% → US-East, (100–x)% → US-West), or dynamic based on health checks
* **Data Synchronization Across Regions:**

  * **Asynchronous Replication:** replicate Master DB in Region A to a replica in Region B (and vice versa for failover)
  * **Multi-Master NoSQL:** e.g., DynamoDB Global Tables or Cassandra multi-DC clusters for low-latency writes worldwide (allows eventual consistency)
* **Failure Scenarios:**

  * If Region A goes down → GeoDNS shifts all traffic to Region B
  * Promote a replica in Region B to become writable Master (if using SQL)
  * Re-sync data when Region A comes back (catch-up replication)
* **Challenges:**

  * Cross-region replication lag
  * Conflict resolution if users write in multiple regions (unless single-primary write is enforced)
  * Testing & deployment complexity (keep infra consistent across DCs)

---

## 10. Message Queue (Asynchronous Decoupling)

* **Role:** buffer and asynchronously deliver tasks/events between components
* **Basic Model:**

  * **Producers/Publishers:** services (e.g., web servers) that enqueue messages
  * **Message Queue (Broker):** RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka (durable queue)
  * **Consumers/Workers:** pick up messages from the queue, process them (e.g., image processing, email sending, analytics)
* **Advantages:**

  * **Loose Coupling:** web tier publishes a job and continues immediately (don’t block on long tasks)
  * **Elasticity:** scale consumers independently based on queue depth
  * **Fault Tolerance:** if a worker crashes, unacknowledged messages stay in queue until retried
* **Use Cases:**

  * **Photo Processing Jobs:** web servers enqueue “customize this photo,” workers resize/crop/blur asynchronously
  * **Notification Service:** enqueue “send welcome email,” worker sends email without delaying user signup
  * **Analytics/Event Logging:** fire-and-forget events → analytics pipeline
* **Retries & DLQs (Dead Letter Queues):**

  * On repeated failures, messages go to DLQ for manual inspection
  * Implement exponential backoff for retrying failed jobs

---

## 11. Logging, Metrics & Automation (Observability)

* **Why It Matters:**

  * Small sites can survive without sophisticated tooling; large systems require full observability to detect, diagnose, and triage issues in real time
* **Logging:**

  * **Structured Logs** (JSON) with fields:

    * `timestamp`, `service_name`, `instance_id`, `request_id`, `user_id`, `severity`, `message`
  * **Central Aggregation:**

    * Agents (Filebeat/Fluentd) send logs to Elasticsearch/Logstash/Kibana (ELK) or Splunk
    * Benefits: search across servers, index by fields, visualize trends
* **Metrics:**

  * **Host-Level:** CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O (via Prometheus node exporters)
  * **Application-Level:**

    * QPS (queries per second)
    * Latency percentiles (P50/P95/P99)
    * Error rate (HTTP 5xx/4xx ratios)
    * DB connection pool utilization
  * **Business-Level:**

    * DAU/MAU trends
    * Signup conversion rate
    * Average revenue per user
* **Dashboards & Alerts:**

  * **Grafana** dashboards grouped by tier (web, DB, cache, queue)
  * Set alert thresholds:

    * **Latency:** P99 > 500 ms → page performance likely degraded
    * **Error Rate:** >1% 5xx for 5 minutes → potential downstream issue
    * **DB Replication Lag:** >10 s → stale reads may be an issue
    * **Queue Depth:** >1,000 messages → backlogged workers
  * Notify via PagerDuty/Slack/email to on-call engineers
* **Distributed Tracing:**

  * Use **OpenTelemetry**, **Zipkin**, or **Jaeger**
  * Propagate `trace_id` + `span_id` through microservices to trace end-to-end request flow
  * Pinpoint latency hotspots (e.g., slow DB queries, slow downstream service calls)
* **Automation & CI/CD:**

  * **Build Pipeline:**

    1. Code push → run unit/integration tests → static code analysis (lint/SAST)
    2. Build container image (Docker) → push to registry
  * **Deployment Pipeline:**

    1. Deploy to staging → smoke tests → manual/automated approval
    2. Deploy to production using blue-green or canary strategy → monitor metrics → ramp up traffic
  * **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**

    * Terraform or CloudFormation for provisioning VPCs, subnets, instances, LB, security groups
    * Keep state in secure storage (e.g., S3 with DynamoDB locking)
  * **Auto-Scaling Policies:**

    * **Web Tier:** scale out when CPU > 60% for 5 min; scale in when CPU < 20% for 10 min
    * **Worker Pool:** scale based on queue length (e.g., if >1000 messages, add 2 workers; if <100, remove 1)

---

## 12. Database Scaling: Vertical vs. Horizontal & Sharding

### 12.1 Vertical Scaling (SQL)

* **Scale Up:** move to a larger instance (e.g., RDS instance with 24 TB RAM)
* **Pros:** simple copy data to bigger machine, fewer distributed concerns
* **Cons:** hardware limits, expensive, SPOF risk still present

### 12.2 Horizontal Scaling (SQL Sharding)

* **Sharding = split large database into smaller units (“shards”):**

  * Each shard holds a subset of data (same schema, different rows)
  * Shard key (partition key) determines which shard holds a given row
* **Example Sharding Strategy:**

  * `shard_id = user_id % N_shards` → user 23 `%` 4 = 3 → goes to shard 3
  * Application uses consistent hashing or directory to locate correct shard
* **Pros:**

  * Each shard is smaller → faster indexes, reduced contention
  * Can scale out by adding shards as needed
* **Cons / Challenges:**

  * Harder to perform joins across shards → often require de-normalization
  * Resharding complexity when adding/removing shards (move data across machines)
  * “Hot Shard” / “Celebrity Problem”: if certain IDs have huge traffic, that shard is overloaded → mitigate by isolating hot keys to dedicated shards or caching heavily
* **Resharding Solutions:**

  * Use **consistent hashing** (minimal data movement when adding/removing nodes)
  * Build an automated migration service to rehash existing data in batches

---

## 13. Polyglot Persistence (When & Where to Use NoSQL)

* **Relational DB (RDBMS) vs. NoSQL:**

  * **RDBMS (SQL):**

    * Strong ACID guarantees, schema-based (tables/rows), joins across tables
    * Mature tooling, but can struggle with huge write volumes / unstructured data
  * **NoSQL (Key-Value, Document, Column, Graph):**

    * Schema-flexible, horizontally scalable, eventual consistency (often tunable)
    * Good fit for unstructured data, ultra low-latency reads (caching), very high write throughput (e.g., logs, metrics)
* **When to Use NoSQL:**

  1. **Super-low latency** needs (e.g., session store, real-time leaderboard)
  2. **Unstructured or semi-structured data** (e.g., JSON user profiles, product catalogs)
  3. **Massive write volumes** (e.g., activity logs, analytics events)
  4. **Denormalized access patterns** (e.g., storing entire user feed in one document)
* **Examples:**

  * **Redis:** key-value, in-memory cache + session store
  * **Cassandra:** wide-column store for time series or event data (high write throughput)
  * **MongoDB:** document store for flexible JSON data (e.g., comments, user preferences)
  * **Neo4j:** graph database for social graph or recommendation queries
* **Polyglot Best Practices:**

  * Use each data store where it shines; avoid forcing all data into one model
  * Handle cross-store consistency carefully (e.g., write to SQL + publish an event to update NoSQL cache)
  * Monitor and set appropriate replication/failover for each store

## 14. Final “Millions and Beyond”: Continuous Iteration

* **Incremental Evolution:**

  1. **Monolith → Split Web/Data** → adds basic separation
  2. **Add LB → Stateless Web Tier** → horizontal web scaling
  3. **DB Replication → Caching → CDN** → improve performance, reliability
  4. **Multi-Region** → global reach, high availability
  5. **Message Queues → Microservices** → loosely coupled, independently scalable
  6. **Sharding → NoSQL** → support massive data volumes & extremely high QPS
* **Key Principles to Remember:**

  1. **Keep Web Tier Stateless:** store sessions externally (Redis/DB/JWT)
  2. **Build Redundancy Everywhere:** ≥2 instances per tier, multi-AZ/multi-region
  3. **Cache Aggressively:** use Redis/Memcached for hot data; put static content on CDN
  4. **Scale Data Tier Thoughtfully:** replicate before you shard; shard only when replication exhausts capacity
  5. **Decouple via Messaging:** synchronous paths stay fast; long-running tasks move to queues/consumers
  6. **Monitor & Automate:**

     * Centralized logging + metrics + distributed tracing
     * CI/CD pipelines + Infrastructure as Code + auto-scaling policies
  7. **Design for Failure:** assume any component can (and will) fail—design failover/fallback strategies
  8. **Evolve Continuously:** measure real traffic/latency bottlenecks, then add complexity (sharding, new datastores, new regions) when justified
