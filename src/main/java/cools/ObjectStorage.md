Here’s a **system design interview-style answer** that explains **how a CDN and the S3-like URL (`https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/photo.jpg`) work together** in an **object storage architecture**—with focus on **performance, security, scalability**, and **reliability**.

## 🎯 **System Design Interview Answer: Object Storage + CDN + S3-style URL**

---

### 💡 **Scenario**

A client browser requests this image:

```
https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/photo.jpg
```

You’re asked:

> "Explain how this system is designed to serve static media reliably, securely, and at scale—using object storage, CDN, and HTTP access."

---

### 🧱 **System Components**

1. **Client** – makes HTTP GET request to the object URL.
2. **CDN (e.g., CloudFront, Fastly)** – edge cache for static assets.
3. **API Gateway / Load Balancer** – optional, forwards traffic to storage backend.
4. **Object Storage (e.g., AWS S3)** – stores media as objects in buckets.
5. **Metadata Store** – maps bucket+key → storage location(s).
6. **Data Nodes** – store object chunks or full replicas.
7. **Access Control** – IAM, pre-signed URLs, or ACLs secure access.

---

### 🌐 **Request Flow Breakdown**

#### 🔁 Step-by-step GET request to:

```
https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/path/to/photo.jpg
```

#### 1. **DNS & CDN Resolution**

* The hostname (`mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com`) resolves to a **CDN edge node** (if a CDN is configured).
* If the object is **cached at the edge**, it is immediately returned → super low latency.

#### 2. **CDN Cache Miss (Optional)**

* If not cached:

  * CDN sends request to the **origin** → `S3` or `Object Gateway`.
  * Object retrieved from the nearest data node(s).

#### 3. **Object Storage Access**

* The object key (`path/to/photo.jpg`) is parsed.
* **Metadata store** determines the location (data node or shard group).
* Object is streamed from the backend.

#### 4. **CDN Caching**

* Object is cached at the edge with TTL headers (`Cache-Control`, `ETag`, etc.).
* Future requests from nearby clients are served **instantly from cache**.

#### 5. **Client Response**

* Object served with headers: `ETag`, `Content-Type`, `Last-Modified`, etc.
* If pre-signed or restricted, client must provide token/key for access.

---

### 🔐 **Security Considerations**

* Use **pre-signed URLs** for time-limited access (e.g., signed S3 URL expires in 15 mins).
* Enforce **HTTPS** via CDN and origin (TLS in transit).
* Apply **bucket policies or IAM roles** to restrict public access.

---

### 📦 **Storage Backend Design**

* Objects stored with **3× replication** or **erasure coding**.
* Metadata service (e.g., DynamoDB, Cassandra, Spanner) tracks versions and ACLs.
* Supports **range GETs** (e.g., for video scrubbing).
* Can handle billions of objects with **consistent hashing** for partitioning.

---

### 📊 **Performance & Scalability**

* **CDN** reduces origin traffic and latency; improves global performance.
* **S3 URL model** (bucket + key) is **cache-friendly** and **stateless**.
* Metadata and data layers **scale independently** (shared-nothing architecture).
* You can autoscale:

  * **Edge nodes (CDN)** for read surge.
  * **Data nodes** for capacity growth.

---

### 💸 **Cost Optimization**

* Enable **lifecycle policies**: auto-move old images to cold storage.
* Use **compressed object formats** (e.g., WebP, gzip).
* CDN cuts origin costs by serving from edge.

---

### ✅ **Real-World Systems**

* **Instagram**: User photos uploaded via S3 API, then fronted by **CloudFront**.
* **Airbnb**: Listing images stored in **S3**, cached via **Fastly**.
* **Dropbox**: URLs like `dl.dropboxusercontent.com/file.jpg` backed by custom object store + CDN.

---

### 🧠 **Interview-Ready Conclusion**

> “When a user accesses a static object via a URL like `https://mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com/...`, we first serve it via CDN. If it’s a cache miss, the request goes to our object storage backend. Each object is stored with redundancy and accessed via distributed metadata. The CDN reduces latency and cost, while versioned URLs ensure consistency. For security, we use pre-signed URLs or access tokens. The design scales linearly as data and traffic grow.”

Absolutely. Here's a clear **system design interview-ready explanation** of the **three fundamental storage models**—Relational, Document-Based, and Key-Value—along with **real-world use cases**, **core principles**, and **when to use what**.

---

## 📦 1. **Relational Storage (SQL, ACID)**

### 🔹 Description:

* Stores data in **tables** (rows and columns).
* Enforces **schema** and **relationships** (foreign keys, joins).
* Guarantees **ACID** properties:

  * **A**tomicity – all or nothing.
  * **C**onsistency – always valid state.
  * **I**solation – concurrent transactions behave as if serialized.
  * **D**urability – once committed, changes persist even after failure.

### ✅ Use Cases:

* **Banking systems**: Money transfers need atomicity and consistency.
* **E-commerce**: Orders, inventory, and transactions must be tightly linked and consistent.
* **ERP/CRM**: Structured, interrelated data with complex queries.

### 🏢 Real Examples:

* **PostgreSQL** for financial platforms.
* **MySQL** for web applications with strict data integrity.
* **Oracle DB** for enterprise workloads.

---

## 📄 2. **Document-Based Storage (NoSQL, BASE)**

### 🔹 Description:

* Stores data as **JSON-like documents**.
* Flexible schema – fields can vary between documents.
* Favors **BASE** model:

  * **B**asically Available – system works even if some nodes are down.
  * **S**oft state – intermediate states are OK.
  * **E**ventually Consistent – data may be temporarily inconsistent, but converges.

### ✅ Use Cases:

* **User profiles**: Every user has a unique set of preferences and settings.
* **Content management systems**: Articles, blogs, and comments have dynamic structures.
* **Mobile apps**: Frequent schema changes, offline sync support.

### 🏢 Real Examples:

* **MongoDB** for storing user-generated content in social apps.
* **Couchbase** for session data in gaming apps.
* **Firestore (Firebase)** for real-time chat apps.

---

## 🔑 3. **Key-Value Storage (NoSQL, BASE)**

### 🔹 Description:

* Simplest form of data storage: **Key → Value**
* No schema, no relationships.
* Ultra-fast reads/writes, highly scalable.
* Often in-memory (blazing fast), or persistent (durable).

### ✅ Use Cases:

* **Caching**: Store session tokens, user auth data.
* **Leaderboards**: Store scores keyed by user ID.
* **Feature toggles**: Lookup of application configuration flags.

### 🏢 Real Examples:

* **Redis** for in-memory caching and pub-sub.
* **DynamoDB** for scalable e-commerce product catalogs.
* **Riak / etcd** for distributed config storage.

## ⚖️ ACID vs BASE: When to Use What?

| Need               | Choose                     | Reason                                |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Strong consistency | **Relational DB (ACID)**   | Critical for money, inventory, orders |
| High flexibility   | **Document DB (BASE)**     | Schema-less for evolving data models  |
| Ultra-low latency  | **Key-Value Store (BASE)** | Perfect for caching, quick lookups    |
| Horizontal scale   | **Document / Key-Value**   | Distributed by design                 |
| Complex queries    | **Relational DB**          | Joins, filters, transactions          |

---

## 💬 Final Interview Talking Points

1. **Start with use case**, then justify storage choice:

   > "For a banking system, I’d choose a relational database like PostgreSQL to enforce transactional integrity across accounts."

2. **Explain the trade-off**:

   > "In contrast, for a dynamic blog platform with varying content types, I’d use MongoDB to avoid rigid schema design."

3. **Mention evolution**:

   > "We often combine them—e.g., Redis for caching, MongoDB for content, and PostgreSQL for billing."
