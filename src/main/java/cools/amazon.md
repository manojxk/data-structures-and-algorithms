### Pro Tips for Using This List

1. **Vary by audience** – don’t recycle; show you *Dive Deep* by referencing prior answers (“Earlier, Alice mentioned X; could you expand on …”).
2. **Track themes** – jot which LPs recur. Mention patterns to demonstrate *Learn & Be Curious*.
3. **Time-box** – 2–3 crisp questions per interviewer keep you on schedule.
4. **STAR in reverse** – if they answer briefly, probe with “Situation? Task? Action? Result?” to model Amazon’s answer style.
5. **Close strong** – end with the feedback-loop question (“Any reservations about my fit?”). Very few candidates dare; those who do often win the offer. ([Day One Careers][2])
