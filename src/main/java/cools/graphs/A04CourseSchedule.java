 Problem: Course Schedule

 You are given a total of numCourses labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1, and an array prerequisites where
 prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that you must take course bi first if you want to take course ai.

 Return true if you can finish all the courses. Otherwise, return false.

 Example 1:
 Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
 Output: true
 Explanation: You can take course 0 first and then course 1.

 Example 2:
 Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0],[0,1]]
 Output: false
 Explanation: There is a cycle, making it impossible to finish all courses.

 Constraints:
 - The number of courses is in the range [1, 2000].
 - The number of prerequisite pairs is in the range [0, 5000].
 - prerequisites[i].length == 2
 - 0 <= ai, bi < numCourses
 - All the prerequisite pairs are unique.

 Solution Approach:
 1. This is a problem of detecting cycles in a directed graph.
 2. The courses can be represented as nodes, and prerequisites as directed edges between nodes.
 3. We can perform a topological sort using Kahnâ€™s Algorithm (BFS) or DFS to detect cycles.
 4. If there is a cycle, it is impossible to finish all courses, otherwise, it is possible.
