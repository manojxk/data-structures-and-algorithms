Below is a detailed, step-by-step explanation of the Disk Stacking solution, aimed at a beginner audience. We’ll cover:

1. **Restating the problem**
2. **High-level approach**
3. **Step 1: Sorting the disks**
4. **Step 2: Setting up our DP arrays**
5. **Step 3: Filling the DP table (O(n²) loop)**
6. **Step 4: Backtracking to reconstruct the chosen stack**
7. **Time & space complexity analysis**

## 1. Restating the Problem

You have a list of *n* disks. Each disk is described by three positive integers:

* `width`
* `depth`
* `height`

We want to “stack” some subset of these disks—one on top of another—so that every disk in the stack is strictly smaller in all three dimensions than the disk below it. In other words, if disk A is immediately above disk B, then:

```
   A.width  <  B.width
   A.depth  <  B.depth
   A.height <  B.height
```

Our goal is to choose and order disks so that the *sum* of their heights is as large as possible. Finally, we must return the actual stack—the list of disks from bottom to top—whose total height is maximal.

---

## 2. High-Level Approach

1. **Sort** all disks by one dimension (we’ll choose height for simplicity).
2. Define a 1D array `heights[i]` = “the maximum possible total stack height ending exactly with disk *i* at the top.”
3. Define a 1D array `prev[i]` = “the index of the disk immediately below disk *i* in that optimal stack.”
4. Iterate through disks in ascending height order. For each disk *i*, look back at every smaller disk *j* (with `j < i`) and see if disk *j* can be placed directly below disk *i*. If yes, check whether appending *i* to the stack that ended at *j* yields a higher total height than any other choice.
5. Keep track of which disk index produces the overall maximum stack height.
6. Once the DP loops finish, backtrack from that “max‐height index” using `prev[]` until you hit “no previous disk” (`prev = -1`). That gives you the bottom→top sequence of disks in that tallest stack.

---

## 3. Step 1: Sort the Disks by Height

We begin by sorting the entire list `disks` in ascending order of height (the third coordinate). If two disks have the same height, their relative order doesn’t matter for correctness—any consistent tie-break is fine. Concretely:

```java
disks.sort((a, b) -> a[2] - b[2]); // Compare by a[2] (height)
```

After sorting, we know that whenever we reach index `i`, all disks `j < i` have height ≤ `disks.get(i)[2]`. This makes it easy to consider “stacking a smaller disk below a larger one.”

---

## 4. Step 2: Set Up the DP Arrays

Assume we have `n = disks.size()`. We allocate two arrays of length n:

1. `int[] heights = new int[n];`

   * Meaning: by default, if disk *i* stands alone, its stack height is simply its own height. So we will initialize `heights[i] = disks.get(i)[2]`.

2. `int[] prev = new int[n];`

   * We fill all entries with `-1` initially, meaning “disk *i* has no disk below it yet.”
   * Later, `prev[i] = j` means “in the optimal stack ending at disk *i*, the disk immediately below it is disk *j*.”

```java
int n = disks.size();
int[] heights = new int[n];
int[] prev = new int[n];
Arrays.fill(prev, -1);

// Initialize “each disk alone on the bottom”
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
  heights[i] = disks.get(i)[2]; // its own height
}
```

At this point, if we never stacked anything, the best we could do with disk *i* on top is just its own height `disks.get(i)[2]`. We’ll try to improve that in the next step.

---

## 5. Step 3: Fill the DP Table with O(n²) Loops

We also maintain a variable `maxHeightIndex = 0`, meaning “so far, the tallest single‐disk stack ends at index 0.” As we proceed, we’ll update it whenever we discover a strictly taller stack.

```java
int maxHeightIndex = 0;
```

Now, for each disk *i* from `1` to `n−1`, we look back at every disk *j* with `0 ≤ j < i`. We check:

1. **Can disk *j* go below disk *i*?**
   That requires all three dimensions of *j* be strictly smaller than the corresponding dimensions of *i*.

   ```java
   private static boolean canStack(int[] bottom, int[] top) {
     return bottom[0] < top[0] && bottom[1] < top[1] && bottom[2] < top[2];
   }
   ```

   * `bottom[0]` = width of disk *j*
   * `bottom[1]` = depth of disk *j*
   * `bottom[2]` = height of disk *j*
   * `top[0..2]` = width, depth, height of disk *i*

2. If `canStack(disks.get(j), disks.get(i))` is true, we consider a candidate stack that consists of “the best stack *ending at* disk *j*” plus disk *i* on top. Its total height would be

   ```
   heights[j] + disks.get(i)[2]
   ```

   because `heights[j]` already recorded “maximum height” of any valid stack whose top is disk *j*. Now adding disk *i* bumps the total by `disks.get(i)[2]`.

3. Compare that candidate with the current recorded `heights[i]`. If

   ```
   heights[j] + disks.get(i)[2]  >  heights[i],
   ```

   then we improve `heights[i]` and set `prev[i] = j` (meaning: “in an optimal stack culminating at *i*, the disk below is *j*”).

4. In the same iteration, if the newly updated `heights[i]` exceeds `heights[maxHeightIndex]`, update `maxHeightIndex = i`.

Putting it all together:

```java
// After initialization:
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
  int[] current = disks.get(i);
  for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
    int[] other = disks.get(j);
    // If disk j can sit below disk i:
    if (canStack(other, current)) {
      // Check if stacking j‐stack plus i yields a taller stack than any previously seen for i
      if (heights[i] < heights[j] + current[2]) {
        heights[i] = heights[j] + current[2];
        prev[i] = j;
      }
    }
  }
  // See if the best stack ending at i is taller than the best overall so far
  if (heights[i] > heights[maxHeightIndex]) {
    maxHeightIndex = i;
  }
}
```

At the end of these nested loops:

* `heights[i]` = the maximum total height of any stack whose *top disk* is exactly disk *i*.
* `prev[i]` tells us which disk lies directly beneath disk *i* in that optimal stack.
* `maxHeightIndex` identifies which top‐disk yields the overall tallest stack.

---

## 6. Step 4: Backtrack to Reconstruct the Chosen Stack

Once we know `maxHeightIndex`, we want to build the actual list of disks from bottom to top. We do this by following `prev[]` pointers:

1. Start at `current = maxHeightIndex`.
2. While `current != -1`, insert `disks.get(current)` at the front of a `List<int[]> sequence`.
3. Then set `current = prev[current]`. Repeat until `current == -1`.

Because `prev[i]` was set to the index of the disk immediately below `i`, this effectively walks down the stack from top → bottom. But since we insert each visited disk at the front of our `sequence` list, we end up with bottom → top order in the returned list.

```java
private static List<int[]> buildSequence(List<int[]> disks,
                                         int[] prev,
                                         int currentIdx) {
  List<int[]> sequence = new ArrayList<>();
  while (currentIdx != -1) {
    // Insert at front so that the final order is bottom→…→top
    sequence.add(0, disks.get(currentIdx));
    currentIdx = prev[currentIdx];
  }
  return sequence;
}
```

Putting the two pieces together, the public method becomes:

```java
public static List<int[]> diskStacking(List<int[]> disks) {
  // 1) Sort by height
  disks.sort((a, b) -> a[2] - b[2]);

  int n = disks.size();
  int[] heights = new int[n];
  int[] prev = new int[n];
  Arrays.fill(prev, -1);

  // 2) Initialize “each disk alone”
  for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    heights[i] = disks.get(i)[2];
  }

  int maxHeightIndex = 0;

  // 3) Fill DP via O(n^2) nested loops
  for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    int[] current = disks.get(i);
    for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
      int[] other = disks.get(j);
      if (canStack(other, current)) {
        if (heights[i] < heights[j] + current[2]) {
          heights[i] = heights[j] + current[2];
          prev[i] = j;
        }
      }
    }
    if (heights[i] > heights[maxHeightIndex]) {
      maxHeightIndex = i;
    }
  }

  // 4) Reconstruct the tallest stack
  return buildSequence(disks, prev, maxHeightIndex);
}
```

---

## 7. Time & Space Complexity

1. **Sorting step:**

   * Sorting `n` disks by their height takes $O(n \log n)$.
2. **DP filling (nested loops):**

   * We do `for i in [1..n−1]` and inside `for j in [0..i−1]` a constant‐time check and update.
   * That double loop is $O(n^2)$.
3. The backtracking to build the sequence is at most $O(n)$ in the worst case (if every disk gets stacked).

Overall:

> **Time Complexity:**
>
> $$
> O(n \log n) \;+\; O(n^2) \;+\; O(n) \;=\; O\bigl(n^2\bigr) 
> \quad\text{(dominant term)}.
> $$

> **Space Complexity:**
>
> * We store three arrays of length $n$: `heights[]`, `prev[]`, and whatever space `sort()` uses (which is $O(n)$ or $O(\log n)$ depending on the sort implementation).
> * We also temporarily build a `List<int[]> sequence`, which in the worst case holds all $n$ disks.
>
> So total extra space is $O(n)$.

### Full Working Example

Below is the complete class with a test in `main()`. You can copy, paste, and run it as is:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class A06DiskStacking {

  // Helper to check if one disk fits strictly inside another
  private static boolean canStack(int[] bottom, int[] top) {
    return bottom[0] < top[0]    // width
        && bottom[1] < top[1]    // depth
        && bottom[2] < top[2];   // height
  }

  // Reconstructs the stack (bottom→top) from prev[] and the final top index
  private static List<int[]> buildSequence(List<int[]> disks,
                                           int[] prev,
                                           int currentIdx) {
    List<int[]> sequence = new ArrayList<>();
    while (currentIdx != -1) {
      sequence.add(0, disks.get(currentIdx));
      currentIdx = prev[currentIdx];
    }
    return sequence;
  }

  // Main DP function: returns the tallest possible stack (list of disks)
  public static List<int[]> diskStacking(List<int[]> disks) {
    // 1) Sort by height
    disks.sort((a, b) -> a[2] - b[2]);

    int n = disks.size();
    int[] heights = new int[n];      // max stack height with disk i on top
    int[] prev    = new int[n];      // index of the disk below disk i
    Arrays.fill(prev, -1);

    // 2) Initialize: if disk i stands alone, stack height = its own height
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
      heights[i] = disks.get(i)[2];
    }

    // 3) DP to fill heights[] and prev[]
    int maxHeightIndex = 0;
    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
      int[] curDisk = disks.get(i);
      for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
        int[] other = disks.get(j);
        if (canStack(other, curDisk)) {
          int possibleHeight = heights[j] + curDisk[2];
          if (possibleHeight > heights[i]) {
            heights[i] = possibleHeight;
            prev[i] = j;
          }
        }
      }
      if (heights[i] > heights[maxHeightIndex]) {
        maxHeightIndex = i;
      }
    }

    // 4) Reconstruct the tallest stack
    return buildSequence(disks, prev, maxHeightIndex);
  }

  // Quick test
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    List<int[]> disks = new ArrayList<>();
    disks.add(new int[] {2, 1, 2});
    disks.add(new int[] {3, 2, 3});
    disks.add(new int[] {2, 2, 8});
    disks.add(new int[] {2, 3, 4});
    disks.add(new int[] {4, 4, 5});

    List<int[]> result = diskStacking(disks);

    System.out.println("Maximum height stack of disks:");
    for (int[] disk : result) {
      System.out.println(Arrays.toString(disk));
    }
    // Expected output (one valid answer):
    // [2, 1, 2]
    // [3, 2, 3]
    // [4, 4, 5]
  }
}
```

**Explanation of the sample run**

1. We start with 5 disks:

   ```
   [2,1,2], [3,2,3], [2,2,8], [2,3,4], [4,4,5]
   ```

2. Sort by height yields (in order of height 2, 3, 4, 5, 8):

   ```
   index 0: [2, 1, 2]
   index 1: [3, 2, 3]
   index 2: [2, 3, 4]
   index 3: [4, 4, 5]
   index 4: [2, 2, 8]
   ```

3. Initialize:

   * `heights = [2,3,4,5,8]` (just each disk’s standalone height),
   * `prev = [-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]`,
   * `maxHeightIndex = 4` (because 8 is currently the largest).

4. Now do the nested loops:

   * **i = 1 (disk = \[3,2,3])**

     * j = 0: can `[2,1,2]` go under `[3,2,3]`? Yes.
       → `heights[1]` would become `heights[0] + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5`. That’s bigger than the old `heights[1] = 3`, so update:

       ```
       heights[1] = 5;  prev[1] = 0
       ```
     * Now compare `heights[1]=5` vs `heights[maxHeightIndex]=8`. Not bigger, so `maxHeightIndex` stays 4.
   * **i = 2 (disk = \[2,3,4])**

     * j=0: can `[2,1,2]` sit under `[2,3,4]`? No, because widths are equal (2 ≱ 2).
     * j=1: can `[3,2,3]` sit under `[2,3,4]`? No: 3 ≱ 2 in width.
       → so `heights[2]` remains 4 (no stacking).
   * **i = 3 (disk = \[4,4,5])**

     * j=0: `[2,1,2]` under `[4,4,5]`? Yes → candidate height = `heights[0]+5 = 2+5 = 7`. That improves `heights[3]` from 5 → 7, so `prev[3]=0`.
     * j=1: `[3,2,3]` under `[4,4,5]`? Yes → candidate height = `heights[1]+5 = 5+5 = 10`. That is even larger, so `heights[3]=10`, `prev[3]=1`.
     * j=2: `[2,3,4]` under `[4,4,5]`? Yes → candidate height = `heights[2]+5 = 4+5 = 9`. But `9 < 10`, so ignore.
       → final `heights[3] = 10`,  `prev[3] = 1`. Compare `10` vs `heights[4]=8`, so now `maxHeightIndex = 3`.
   * **i = 4 (disk = \[2,2,8])**

     * j=0: `[2,1,2]` under `[2,2,8]`? No (width 2 ≱ 2).
     * j=1: `[3,2,3]` under `[2,2,8]`? No (3 ≱ 2).
     * j=2: `[2,3,4]` under `[2,2,8]`? No.
     * j=3: `[4,4,5]` under `[2,2,8]`? No.
       → No improvements; `heights[4]` stays 8. Compare vs `heights[maxHeightIndex]=10`: no change.

   Final arrays:

   ```
   heights = [  2,  5,  4, 10,  8 ]
   prev    = [ -1,  0, -1,  1, -1 ]
   maxHeightIndex = 3  (disk [4,4,5], total height 10)
   ```

5. **Backtracking from index = 3**:

   * start `currentIdx = 3`, add `disks.get(3) = [4,4,5]` → sequence = `[ [4,4,5] ]`.
   * then `prev[3] = 1`, so `currentIdx = 1`, add `disks.get(1) = [3,2,3]` at front → sequence = `[ [3,2,3], [4,4,5] ]`.
   * then `prev[1] = 0`, so `currentIdx = 0`, add `disks.get(0) = [2,1,2]` at front → sequence = `[ [2,1,2], [3,2,3], [4,4,5] ]`.
   * `prev[0] = -1`, stop.

Hence we output:

```
[[2,1,2],
 [3,2,3],
 [4,4,5]]
```

This stack’s combined height = 2 + 3 + 5 = 10, which is maximal.

---

## Final Takeaways

* **Sorting** (by height) ensures that we only try to put a smaller disk below a larger one.
* **DP array `heights[i]`** stores “best total height of a stack whose top is disk *i*.”
* **DP transition:** for each 0 ≤ j < i, if `disks[j]` can fit under `disks[i]`, update

  ```
    heights[i] = max(heights[i], heights[j] + disks[i][2]);  
    prev[i] = j;  
  ```
* **Keep track** of which index yields the absolute largest `heights[i]` → that is `maxHeightIndex`.
* **Backtrack** along `prev[]` from `maxHeightIndex` to build the bottom→top list of disks.

**Complexities**

* Time: $O(n^2)$ due to the double loop over `i` and `j`.
* Space: $O(n)$ for the two arrays (`heights[]`, `prev[]`) plus output storage.

This completes the full, beginner-friendly explanation of the Disk Stacking DP solution.
