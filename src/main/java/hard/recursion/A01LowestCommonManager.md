**Problem Restatement**
You have an organizational chart represented by a tree of `OrgChart` nodes. Each node has a `name` (a char) and a list of `directReports` (its children). You’re given a reference to the “top manager” (the root of the tree), plus two distinct nodes somewhere in this chart, `reportOne` and `reportTwo`. Your job is to find the **lowest common manager**—i.e., the deepest node in the tree that is an ancestor of both `reportOne` and `reportTwo`. Return that node (not just its name).

In other words, imagine the chart:

```
            A
           / \
          B   C
         / \ / \
        D  E F  G
       / \
      H   I
```

If `reportOne = E` and `reportTwo = I`, the lowest common manager is `B`, because:

* Both `E` and `I` are somewhere under `B`, and
* `B` is lower in the hierarchy than `A` (the only other shared ancestor).

Below is a brief overview of what your path‐based solution does, along with its complexity and a few notes on how it compares to the single‐pass recursive approach shown earlier.

## What Your Path‐Based Solution Does

1. **Find the path from `topManager` to `reportOne`**

   * `findPath(topManager, reportOne, pathToReportOne)` does a DFS. It adds each visited node onto `pathToReportOne`; as soon as it reaches `reportOne`, it returns true, leaving the list populated with the exact sequence of ancestors (from the root down to `reportOne`).

2. **Find the path from `topManager` to `reportTwo`**

   * Similarly, `findPath(topManager, reportTwo, pathToReportTwo)` populates `pathToReportTwo` with all ancestors leading to `reportTwo`.

3. **Compare the two paths to locate the LCM**

   * Once you have both lists—say

     ```
     pathToReportOne = [ A, B, D, … , reportOne ]
     pathToReportTwo = [ A, B, D, … , reportTwo ]
     ```
   * You iterate from the beginning (index 0) up until the last index at which they share the same node. That last shared node is the lowest common manager.

### Code Walkthrough

```java
public static OrgChart getLowestCommonManager(
    OrgChart topManager, OrgChart reportOne, OrgChart reportTwo) {
  List<OrgChart> pathToReportOne = new ArrayList<>();
  List<OrgChart> pathToReportTwo = new ArrayList<>();

  // 1) Populate the path up to each report
  findPath(topManager, reportOne, pathToReportOne);
  findPath(topManager, reportTwo, pathToReportTwo);

  // 2) Walk both lists in parallel until they diverge
  int i = 0;
  while (i < pathToReportOne.size()
      && i < pathToReportTwo.size()
      && pathToReportOne.get(i) == pathToReportTwo.get(i)) {
    i++;
  }

  // The last index before divergence (i−1) is the LCM
  return pathToReportOne.get(i - 1);
}

// DFS helper to build a path list from currentNode down to target (if it exists)
private static boolean findPath(OrgChart currentNode,
                                OrgChart target,
                                List<OrgChart> path) {
  if (currentNode == null) return false;
  path.add(currentNode);

  if (currentNode == target) {
    return true; 
  }

  // Try each direct report
  for (OrgChart dr : currentNode.directReports) {
    if (findPath(dr, target, path)) {
      return true; 
    }
  }

  // If not found in this subtree, backtrack
  path.remove(path.size() - 1);
  return false;
}
```

## Time and Space Complexity

1. **Finding each path (`findPath`)**

   * In the worst case, you may visit every node in the tree until you locate the target. That takes **O(n)** time (where `n` is the total number of nodes in the entire org chart).
   * You do this twice (once for `reportOne`, once for `reportTwo`), so that part is **O(n) + O(n) = O(n)** overall.

2. **Storing each path**

   * A single path from the root down to a given node can be at most `d` elements long, where `d` is the tree’s depth.
   * So each `pathToReport…` list uses **O(d)** space. (In the worst case, if the tree is a straight chain, then `d` could be up to `n`, but typically `d ≤ n`.)

3. **Comparing the two paths**

   * Once you have two lists of length at most `d`, you compare them element by element. That is **O(d)**.

Putting it all together:

* **Time:** O(n) to find the first path + O(n) to find the second path + O(d) to compare → **O(n)** in total (the O(d) is subsumed by O(n)).
* **Space:** O(d) for the first list + O(d) for the second list → **O(d)** total extra space.

## How This Compares to the Single‐Pass “OrgInfo” Method

1. **Single‐Pass Method (OrgInfo)**

   * Recursively traverses the tree **once**, carrying two integers up (how many important reports found so far, plus a possible LCM pointer).
   * **Time:** O(n) — visits each node at most once.
   * **Space:** O(d) recursion stack, but **no additional lists** of size d or n.

2. **Path‐Based Method**

   * Does two separate DFS traversals (one for each report path), plus a final O(d) comparison.
   * **Time:** Still O(n) overall, but effectively it may visit many nodes twice (once on each DFS).
   * **Space:** O(d) for storing each of the two paths. So it uses roughly 2 × O(d) instead of just the O(d) recursion stack.

Both approaches run in linear time, but:

* The **single‐pass OrgInfo method** is slightly more “economical,” because:

  * It performs only one DFS.
  * It never needs to store two full path lists; it only needs a couple of counters and a single pointer at each recursion frame.

* The **path‐based method** is often easier to reason about (you explicitly build “root→node” paths, then compare). However, it does two separate traversals and stores two path lists.

---

## Summary

* **Your current solution** finds each path from the root to a report (two separate DFS calls), then compares those two paths to pick out their last common node.

  * **Time:** O(n)
  * **Space:** O(d) to store the two paths (total O(2d) = O(d))

* **Alternative single‐pass solution (OrgInfo)** does a bottom‐up recursion that returns, for each subtree, how many of the reports it contains and, if it contains both, which node is the LCM.

  * **Time:** O(n)
  * **Space:** O(d) recursion depth, no extra O(d) lists

Either approach is correct—yours is perfectly fine if you’re comfortable storing the two ancestor‐lists. If you want to avoid storing those two lists (and cut the number of traversals in half), you can switch to the “single‐pass” OrgInfo recursion. Both ultimately run in linear time and need no more than O(depth) extra space.
