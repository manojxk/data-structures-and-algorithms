Step-by-Step Explanation:
Edge Class:

This class defines an edge with three attributes: src (source vertex), dest (destination vertex), and weight (weight of the edge).
It implements the Comparable interface to allow sorting edges by weight.
KruskalSimplified Class:

It represents the graph. The constructor initializes the graph with a given number of vertices.
The graph uses a list of edges (edges).
addEdge Method:

Adds an edge to the list of edges with the specified source, destination, and weight.
        find Method (Union-Find with Path Compression):

It recursively finds the root of the vertex i. If the vertex is not its own parent, it updates the parent to the root (path compression).
union Method (Union by Rank):

Combines two sets (vertices) into one. The set with the smaller rank becomes the child of the set with the higher rank. If both have the same rank, one becomes the child, and its rank is incremented.
kruskalMST Method:

Step 1: Sorts all edges by weight using Collections.sort(). This ensures that we consider the smallest weight edges first (greedy approach).
Step 2: Initializes the parent array, where each vertex is its own parent, and the rank array is initialized to zero.
        Step 3: Processes edges in the sorted order:
For each edge, it checks if the source and destination vertices belong to different sets using the find() method. If they do, it adds the edge to the result and merges the sets using the union() method.
Step 4: Stops when the MST contains V-1 edges (where V is the number of vertices).
Step 5: Prints the edges of the MST.
Main Method:

The graph is created with 4 vertices.
Edges are added with the given source, destination, and weight.
Kruskalâ€™s algorithm is applied to find the MST, and the result is printed.
Time Complexity:
Sorting edges: Sorting all edges takes O(E log E), where E is the number of edges.
Union-Find operations: The find and union operations take nearly constant time, so the overall complexity is O(E log V).
Thus, the total time complexity is O(E log E), which simplifies to O(E log V).

Space Complexity:
O(V) for storing the parent and rank arrays.
O(E) for storing the edges list.*/
