/*
 * Problem Statement:
 *
 * You are given the head of a singly linked list that contains a loop. The tail node of the
 * linked list points to some other node within the list, creating a cycle. The task is to return
 * the node (not just its value) where the loop begins. The solution should use constant space (O(1)
 * space complexity).
 *
 * The singly linked list contains nodes with an integer value and a next pointer to the next
 * node in the list.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
 *                      ^                     v
 *                      9 <- 8 <- 7
 *
 * Output: Node with value 4 (the start of the loop)
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
 * Space Complexity: O(1) because we use only two pointers (slow and fast).

/*
 * Explanation of Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare):
 *
 * Step 1 (Cycle Detection):
 * - Use two pointers: a slow pointer (Tortoise) that moves one step at a time, and a fast pointer (Hare) that moves two steps at a time.
 * - If the list contains a cycle, the slow and fast pointers will eventually meet within the loop.
 *
 * Step 2 (Finding the Start of the Loop):
 * - Once the cycle is detected (i.e., slow and fast pointers meet), reset the slow pointer to the head of the list.
 * - Move both slow and fast pointers one step at a time. The node where they meet is the starting point of the loop.
 *
 * Time Complexity:
 * - O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. Both pointers traverse the list a maximum of `n` steps.
 *
 * Space Complexity:
 * - O(1), as we are using only two pointers (slow and fast) without additional data structures.
