/**
 * Problem Statement:
 *
 * <p>You are given the head of a singly linked list that contains a loop. The tail node of the
 * linked list points to some other node within the list, creating a cycle. The task is to return
 * the node (not just its value) where the loop begins. The solution should use constant space (O(1)
 * space complexity).
 *
 * <p>The singly linked list contains nodes with an integer value and a next pointer to the next
 * node in the list.
 *
 * <p>Sample Input: head = 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 ^ v 9 <- 8 <- 7
 *
 * <p>Sample Output: Node with value 4 (the start of the loop)
 *
 * <p>Time Complexity: O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. Space Complexity:
 * O(1) because we use only two pointers.

/*Explanation:
Floydâ€™s Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare):

Step 1 (Cycle Detection): Use two pointers, slow and fast. The slow pointer moves one step at a time, and the fast pointer moves two steps at a time. If there's a cycle, the slow and fast pointers will eventually meet.
Step 2 (Find the Start of the Loop): Once a cycle is detected (when slow and fast meet), reset the slow pointer to the head of the list. Move both slow and fast one step at a time. The node where they meet is the start of the loop.
Time Complexity:

O(n): Each pointer traverses the list once. The maximum number of operations is proportional to the length of the list.
Space Complexity:

O(1): Only two pointers (slow and fast) are used, so the space complexity is constant.*/
