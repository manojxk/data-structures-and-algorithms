Below is a concise explanation of how the “Validate Three Nodes” solution works, followed by a discussion of its time and space complexity.

## Problem Restatement

You are given three distinct nodes (`nodeOne`, `nodeTwo`, `nodeThree`) from the same Binary Search Tree (BST). Determine whether **one** of those nodes is an ancestor of the second node, and that second node is an ancestor of the third node. In other words, check whether either

1. `nodeOne → nodeTwo → nodeThree`

or

2. `nodeThree → nodeTwo → nodeOne`

holds true, where “→” means “is an ancestor of.” If neither ordering yields a valid ancestor chain, return `false`.

---

## How the Code Works

```java
public class A02ValidateThreeNodes {

  // Definition of a BST node
  static class BST {
    int value;
    BST left;
    BST right;
    public BST(int value) {
      this.value = value;
    }
  }

  // Main method: returns true if either nodeOne→nodeTwo→nodeThree 
  // or nodeThree→nodeTwo→nodeOne holds.
  public static boolean validateThreeNodes(BST nodeOne, BST nodeTwo, BST nodeThree) {
    // Case 1: nodeOne is ancestor of nodeTwo, AND nodeTwo is ancestor of nodeThree
    if (isAncestor(nodeOne, nodeTwo) && isAncestor(nodeTwo, nodeThree)) {
      return true;
    }
    // Case 2: nodeThree is ancestor of nodeTwo, AND nodeTwo is ancestor of nodeOne
    if (isAncestor(nodeThree, nodeTwo) && isAncestor(nodeTwo, nodeOne)) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

  // Helper: returns true if nodeA is an ancestor of nodeB (i.e. nodeB appears in A's subtree).
  private static boolean isAncestor(BST nodeA, BST nodeB) {
    // Traverse down from nodeA, searching for nodeB by BST property.
    while (nodeA != null && nodeA != nodeB) {
      if (nodeB.value < nodeA.value) {
        nodeA = nodeA.left;
      } else {
        nodeA = nodeA.right;
      }
    }
    return (nodeA == nodeB);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Build a small tree for testing:
    BST nodeOne = new BST(5);
    BST nodeTwo = new BST(2);
    BST nodeThree = new BST(3);
    nodeOne.left = nodeTwo;
    nodeTwo.right = nodeThree;
    // That subtree is: 5 → left→ 2 → right→ 3

    System.out.println(
      validateThreeNodes(nodeOne, nodeTwo, nodeThree)
    ); // Expected: true, because 5 is ancestor of 2 and 2 is ancestor of 3.

    // Now attach more nodes elsewhere:
    BST nodeFour = new BST(8);
    BST nodeFive = new BST(6);
    nodeOne.right = nodeFour;
    nodeFour.left = nodeFive;
    // The tree is now:
    //     5
    //    / \
    //   2   8
    //    \ / 
    //    3 6

    System.out.println(
      validateThreeNodes(nodeOne, nodeFour, nodeFive)
    ); // Expected: false, because 5→8→6 is valid but the code checks only the two specific orderings, and (8→6→5) is not “nodeOne→nodeTwo→nodeThree” nor “nodeThree→nodeTwo→nodeOne” for the given parameters.
  }
}
```

### Explanation of Key Steps

1. **Two Possible Orderings**
   We need to check **exactly two** orderings of ancestor/descendant:

   * **Order A**: `nodeOne` must be an ancestor of `nodeTwo` **and** `nodeTwo` must be an ancestor of `nodeThree`. If both hold, return `true`.
   * **Order B**: `nodeThree` must be an ancestor of `nodeTwo` **and** `nodeTwo` must be an ancestor of `nodeOne`. If both hold, return `true`.

   If neither ordering holds, return `false`. That covers all possible “nodeTwo stays in the middle” scenarios.

2. **`isAncestor(nodeA, nodeB)`**
   To determine if `nodeA` is an ancestor of `nodeB` in a BST, we exploit the BST property:

   * Start at `nodeA`.
   * While `nodeA` is not `null` and not yet `nodeB`:

     * If `nodeB.value < nodeA.value`, move into `nodeA.left`.
     * Otherwise, move into `nodeA.right` (since in this BST definition, right‐children hold values ≥ the parent).
   * If we eventually stumble upon exactly `nodeB`, return `true`. If we reach `null` first, return `false`.

   In effect, we are “binary‐searching” from `nodeA` for the value `nodeB.value`. If that search leads to the exact node reference `nodeB`, then `nodeA` lies on the path from the root down to `nodeB`, so `nodeA` is an ancestor.

3. **Combining the Checks**

   * First, `if (isAncestor(nodeOne, nodeTwo) && isAncestor(nodeTwo, nodeThree)) return true;`
   * Else, `if (isAncestor(nodeThree, nodeTwo) && isAncestor(nodeTwo, nodeOne)) return true;`
   * Otherwise, return `false`.

   These two blocks ensure we only return `true` if the chain goes exactly “A → B → C” or “C → B → A” in terms of ancestry.

## Time & Space Complexity

* **`isAncestor(...)` Traversal**: In a BST of height *h*, each call does at most *h* comparisons—moving one level down per iteration. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), *h = O(n)* for *n* nodes; in a balanced BST, *h = O(log n)*.

* **Total Work in `validateThreeNodes(...)`**:

  1. At most **two calls** to `isAncestor` for the first ordering.
  2. If that fails, at most **two calls** to `isAncestor` for the second ordering.
  3. Hence at most **4** calls to `isAncestor`.

* **Overall Time Complexity**:

  * Worst‐case (unbalanced tree): *O(n)* per `isAncestor` call, × 4 calls ⇒ **O(n)**.
  * In an ideally balanced scenario: *O(log n)* per call × 4 ⇒ **O(log n)**.
  * We typically denote the result as **O(h)**, where *h* is the height of the BST. In the worst case, *h = n,* so **O(n)**.

* **Space Complexity**:

  * We use only a constant amount of extra memory (a few local variables and pointers).
  * Recursion is not used in `isAncestor`—it is purely iterative—so there is no recursion stack.
  * Therefore, **O(1)** extra space.

---

## Why This Covers All Cases

1. If `nodeOne` truly is an ancestor of `nodeTwo`, then either:

   * `nodeTwo` lies in the left‐subtree of `nodeOne` (if `nodeTwo.value < nodeOne.value`), or
   * `nodeTwo` lies in the right‐subtree (if `nodeTwo.value ≥ nodeOne.value`).
     In either sub‐branch, our `isAncestor(nodeOne, nodeTwo)` will eventually follow left/right pointers until it either finds `nodeTwo` or hits `null`.

2. Once `nodeTwo` is found, we then check if `nodeThree` lies under `nodeTwo` in the same fashion.

3. If the first case fails, we try the reversed ordering: maybe `nodeThree` is above `nodeTwo` in the BST, and `nodeTwo` is above `nodeOne`. The same “walk down via BST rules” check tests that scenario.

4. If neither chain of two “ancestor checks” succeeds, there is no way to number the three nodes so that one is parent (or grandparent) of the second, and the second is parent (or grandparent) of the third in BST insertion order.

### Sample Runs

1. **Example 1**

   ```
   nodeOne(5)
       \
        8
   nodeTwo(2)  [actually attached at left of 5]
           \
           nodeThree(3)
   ```

   * `isAncestor(5, 2)` → true (because 2 < 5, go to 5.left = 2).
   * `isAncestor(2, 3)` → true (3 ≥ 2, go to 2.right = 3).
     So `validateThreeNodes(5,2,3) == true`.

2. **Example 2**

   ```
       2
        \
         5
          \
           3
   ```

   * `isAncestor(2, 5)` → false (5 > 2, go to 2.right = 5? Actually if the tree is exactly that shape, `2.right = 5`, so that part is true, but then we still need to check `isAncestor(5, 3)`. But the given example says `nodeOne=2, nodeTwo=5, nodeThree=3` does not form that chain in a valid BST structure from the same tree, so one of the checks will fail. In practice, if 2’s right child is indeed 5, then isAncestor(2,5) is true. Next we check isAncestor(5,3). If 3 is the right child of 5, that would be true—then `validateThreeNodes` would return true, but by the problem statement’s example, that tree did not exist with those nodes in that arrangement. They intended a different tree arrangement where 2 was not an ancestor of 5 in the same BST.)

   In any valid BST containing nodes 2, 5, 3, you cannot have 2 as ancestor of 5 and then 5 as ancestor of 3 without violating BST rules if 3 < 5 but > 2. The example’s point is that you would have to insert 2→5→3 in an order that forces 3 to go left under 5—but then 2 cannot stand above 5 with 3 in its right subtree in a single consistent BST. So eventually one of the `isAncestor` calls fails.

3. **Example 3**

   ```
     nodeOne = 5
              \
               8
               /
             nodeThree = 6 
   nodeTwo = 4 somewhere else or not in that chain.
   ```

   Neither `isAncestor(5,8) && isAncestor(8,6)` nor `isAncestor(6,8) && isAncestor(8,5)` can hold, so the answer is `false`.

---

## Takeaways

* By exploiting the BST property (every left subtree contains smaller values, every right subtree contains larger or equal values), we can walk down from any “candidate ancestor” to see if it eventually reaches the “descendant” node without ever scanning the entire tree. This is **O(h)** per check.
* Because we only need at most two checks, each of which calls `isAncestor` up to twice, overall time is O(h).
* No extra data structures beyond a few pointers or counters are needed, so space is O(1).

Thus, this algorithm efficiently determines whether those three BST nodes can be arranged in a single straight line of ancestry.
