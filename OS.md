### **The Purpose and Types of Operating Systems**

---

#### **Introduction**

An **Operating System (OS)** is a critical piece of software that manages computer hardware and software resources, acting as an intermediary between users and the computer. Its primary purpose is to facilitate user interaction with the hardware while ensuring efficient resource management.

#### **Main Functions of an Operating System**

The OS performs several essential functions:

| **Function**                  | **Description**                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Process Management**        | Manages CPU allocation to various tasks, controlling process creation, execution, and termination. |
| **Memory Management**         | Allocates and deallocates memory space to processes, ensuring efficient memory usage. |
| **File System Management**    | Organizes and controls how data is stored and retrieved on storage devices. |
| **Device Management**         | Manages communication between software applications and hardware devices.  |
| **Security & Access Control** | Protects data and ensures authorized user access through user authentication and permissions. |
| **User Interface**            | Provides a means for users to interact with the system, either via a Command-Line Interface (CLI) or a Graphical User Interface (GUI). |

| **6. Clustered Operating System**           | - Groups multiple computers to form a single system.<br>- Improves performance, availability, and scalability.<br>- Used in high-performance computing, data centers, and cloud computing. | Beowulf cluster, Microsoft Cluster Server   |
| **7. Embedded Operating System**            | - Designed for specialized devices (e.g., IoT, consumer electronics).<br>- Optimized for resource-constrained environments, real-time performance, and low power consumption. | Android Things, FreeRTOS, VxWorks          |

### **Process States in an Operating System**

| **State**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                           |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **New State**            | A program in secondary memory is started for execution; the process is in a new state.                                                                                                 |
| **Ready State**          | After loading into main memory, a process transitions from new to ready. It waits for the CPU to execute it. Multiple processes can be in the ready state in a multiprogramming environment. |
| **Run State**            | A process that is allotted CPU for execution moves from the ready state to the run state.                                                                                              |
| **Terminate State**      | After a process finishes execution, it moves from the run state to the terminate state. The OS deletes the Process Control Block (PCB) in this state.                                    |
| **Block or Wait State**  | If a process requires an I/O operation or a blocked resource, it transitions from run to block or wait state. It moves back to the ready state once the I/O operation or resource is available. |
| **Suspend Ready State**  | If a higher-priority process needs execution while main memory is full, a lower-priority process is moved from ready to suspend ready state, freeing up space for the higher-priority process. |
| **Suspend Wait State**   | Similar to suspend ready, a lower-priority process is moved from wait to suspend wait state to free up memory for higher-priority processes. It moves back to ready once resources or memory are available. |

### **Important Notes**

- **Minimum States**: A process must pass through at least four states (new, run, ready, terminate) to be considered complete. If I/O is required, a minimum of five states is needed.
- **CPU Utilization**: Only one process can run at a time on a single CPU. With \(n\) processors, \(n\) processes can run simultaneously.
- **Memory Presence**:
  - **Secondary Memory**: New state, suspend wait state, suspend ready state
  - **Main Memory**: Ready state, run state, wait state

- **Optimal Suspension**: Moving a process from wait to suspend wait state is preferable when memory is full. This is better than suspending lower-priority ready processes, as the blocked process is already waiting for an unavailable resource.
